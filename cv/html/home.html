      <br>Welcome</h3>
    <p>This website is entirely made with a text editor (more information in "project")</p>
    <p>It's made for people looking for more details about my background. This website is not intended to be quickly read: if you are looking for a quick view <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12g07QKrRXn7GS8aseT6_7P71wO8Yx-gk/view?usp=sharing">you may want to see my CV</a>

    <h4 class="titre2">Quick presentation :</h4>
    <p>I am a student in computer science. <b>I'm specialized in Software Engineering and Computer Science</b> with a focus on new technologies (web, image processing, computer vision, 3D, AI, etc)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm currently doing a <b>master in artificial intelligence at Heriot Watt University (UK)</b>. And I previously did a general engineering degree (equivalent to a Master 2) with courses in <b>electronics, energy, signal processing and networks</b> at ESME Sudria (France) were I also did my specialization.</p>

    <br>
    <p>From my point of view, Deep Learning (or Artificial Intelligence) is fascinating. <b>I started in this field by self learning</b>: I did a voice recognition project in C++ <b>and coded everything from scratch</b> (you can find more on the projects page). I later did a research internship at the school of <b>Mines ParisTech</b> (France) about adversarial examples and active learning.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I'm interested in computer hardware, and I self-learned how to build computers or use embeded systems such as raspbery pi or arduino. <b>I am also very curious</b>, and depending on my involvement, I enjoy relaying or teaching in a simple way what I have learned.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><b>I'm thrilled by challenges</b>, and today the two greatest I had were making the voice recognition software when I didn't knew anything in AI, and having succesfuly taught basics of C++ to children from 7 to 9 while I was working at OSI.</p>
